# Climate Data Statistical Analysis

This repository contains two Applied Statistics computational projects analyzing climate and weather data in India.

## 📊 Project 1: Delhi Climate Analysis (2013–2017)

Analyzes daily climate data of Delhi using:

- Visualizations (bar plots, histograms, box plots, etc.)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, IQR)
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT) simulations
- Correlation and anomaly analysis

## 🌦️ Project 2: Multi-City Weather Analysis (1990–2022)

Performs statistical inference on historical weather data from major Indian cities:

- Point & interval estimation
- Hypothesis testing on rainfall probability
- Confidence intervals on temperature differences
